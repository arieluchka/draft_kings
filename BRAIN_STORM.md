Points to ask/clarify:

1) Why are there 2 endpoints for payment service, that are doing the same (updating balance), but one is for adding balance and the other is for subtracting? Why dont we have one service that either gets +N or -N?

2) Why /payment/placeBet is the starting point? (and not /slot/spin)
