# Known issues/un-addressed points
1) Didn't give special treatment to IDs patterns (transactionId/notificationId) (even tho it's possible to automatically verify response from api, to follow the `txn`/`notif` pattern)

# How and When i used AI
1) to create Request/response objects
2) create api interfaces for every service
3) help with migrating the JS selenium test (from assignment 3) to python-pytest
