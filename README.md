## The flow

### Assumptions
1) user balance cannot be negative


### User possible start points
1) 

### User possible inputs



## 2 API Automation

### Assumptions
- The api services are already running somewhere (not runned locally)

- The apis are returning specific error types for different exceptions (for example, specific error type if user places a bet valued more than the balance he has)


## 3) Code Debugging

[go to](./assignments/assignment_3/code_debugging.md)


# Known issues/un-addressed points
1) Didn't give special treatment to IDs patterns (transactionId/notificationId) (even tho it's possible to automatically verify response from api, to follow the txn/notif pattern)

# How and When i used AI
1) to create Request/response objects
2) create api interfaces for every service
